## Usage

After installation, you can access the application. Since there are no default seeders, you will need to create user accounts.

1.  **Register a User:** The public registration form at `/register` creates a user with the default `orangtua` (parent) role.
2.  **Create Admin/Kader:** To create an `admin` or `kader`, you can manually change a user's role in the `users` table in your database or create a custom seeder.
3.  **Access Portals:**
    - **Admin:** Log in with an admin account and navigate to `/admin/dashboard`.
    - **Kader:** Log in with a kader account and navigate to `/kader/dashboard`.
    - **Orang Tua:** Log in with an orang tua account and navigate to `/orangtua/dashboard`.
